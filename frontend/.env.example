# Optional: Backend API base URL (including /api path).
# - Leave unset for local dev (Vite proxy will forward /api to the backend).
# - For Vercel (or any host where the frontend is not served with the backend),
#   set this to your backend's full API base, e.g.:
#   VITE_API_BASE=https://your-backend.example.com/api
# No trailing slash.

# VITE_API_BASE=https://your-backend.example.com/api
